# CAD Models

STL files for 3D printable parts


- Diffuser Clamp Folder: 3 iterations of the clamp and a template to drill M2-sized through holes
- Pressure Circuit Layout Board Folder: 3 iterations of the layout board. The file "Electronics Layout Board Bottom" has holes that will need to be tapped for M3 screws to be placed in, otherwise use other two models for through holes and tighten with nuts on the end. Use 3 washers on the underside of each hole of the Wheatstone bridge board for a better fit
- EZTops Spacer v2: Half the spacer to use with the small acrylic dome in the EzTops adapter flange
